This template should help get you started developing with Lightweight Charts in Vue 3.

There are two components provided as examples:

- components/composition-api/LWChart.vue
- components/options-api/LWChart.vue

for the Options API and Composition API styles.

Additionally there is an `App.vue` component provided which provides a showcase adn testbed for the components. This is the App which is rendered within the preview.

Finally, there is a `standalone.html` file which shows how to use these component in a 'no-build' situation.
